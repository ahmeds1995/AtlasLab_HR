I am pleased to present this comprehensive report for the HR Department of the fictious software company Atlas Lab.
The report has four pages, where we delve into the demographics of the companyâ€™s employees, find out the average age of the employees, and break the employees by gender, marital status, and ethnicity.
We also tracked the performance of all employees to determine their satisfaction with their job, work environment, and work-life balance.
You can also see the manager's average rate of the employee during his years of work in the company, as well as the employee's self rate.
We delved more deeply into the reasons that may lead to employee attrition, such as business travels, overtime, and the number of years working for the company.

Explore all of this through the interactive Power BI report, and apply the filters you want to delve deeper into the details of Atlas Lab employees.
